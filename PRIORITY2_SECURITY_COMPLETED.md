# Priority 2: Security Hardening - Completion Report

**Completion Date**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

---

## Overview

Priority 2 focused on implementing comprehensive security hardening measures to protect against XSS attacks, fraud, and abuse. All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed.

---

## Completed Security Enhancements

### 1. ✅ HTML Input Sanitization

**Package Installed**: `mews/purifier` (Laravel HTML Purifier)

**New Service**: `app/Services/InputSanitizationService.php`

#### Features Implemented:
- **XSS Prevention**: Automatic HTML sanitization on all user inputs
- **Context-Aware Sanitization**:
  - `sanitize()` - General purpose cleaning
  - `sanitizeNotes()` - Allows basic formatting (p, br, strong, em, u)
  - `sanitizeAddress()` - Strict, no HTML allowed
  - `sanitizeJson()` - Recursive array sanitization
- **Suspicious Pattern Detection**: Identifies malicious code patterns
  - Scripts, iframes, event handlers
  - JavaScript protocol handlers
  - SQL injection attempts

#### Integration Points:
1. **CheckoutController** - All checkout form inputs sanitized
   - Customer notes
   - Delivery addresses (all fields)
   - Delivery instructions

2. **OrderHistoryController** - Cancellation reasons sanitized

3. **AdminOrderController** - Admin notes sanitized

#### Security Patterns Blocked:
```javascript
<script>...</script>
javascript:...
<iframe>...
onclick=, onload=, etc.
eval(...)
expression(...)
```

---

### 2. ✅ Fraud Detection System

**New Service**: `app/Services/FraudDetectionService.php`

#### Velocity Checks:
- **Per User**: Blocks >5 orders per hour
- **Per IP**: Blocks >10 orders per hour from same IP
- **Failed Payments**: Tracks failed attempts, auto-blacklists after 10 failures

#### IP Reputation Monitoring:
- **Blacklist System**: 7-day automatic IP blacklisting
- **Shared IP Detection**: Flags IPs with >5 different users
- **Cache-Based**: Fast lookups with minimal database impact

#### Order Pattern Analysis:
- **Large First Order**: Flags orders >$500 from new users
- **Rapid Escalation**: Detects 3x order amount increases
- **Risk Scoring**: 0-100 risk score calculation

#### Risk Thresholds:
- **Score 70+**: Order blocked, flagged for review
- **Score 40-69**: Order allowed, logged as suspicious
- **Score 0-39**: Order approved

---

### 3. ✅ Suspicious Activity Logging

**Implementation**: Comprehensive logging system

#### What Gets Logged:
1. **High-Risk Checkout Attempts** (Score 70+)
   - Full risk breakdown
   - User details
   - Cart information
   - IP address

2. **Moderate-Risk Checkouts** (Score 40-69)
   - Velocity issues
   - IP reputation concerns
   - Pattern anomalies

3. **Suspicious Input Detection**
   - Malicious code patterns in form fields
   - User ID, IP, and input content
   - Timestamp for investigation

4. **Blocked Orders**
   - Blacklisted IPs
   - Excessive failed payments
   - Critical security violations

#### Log Location:
- Laravel Log: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
- Cache Store: `suspicious_activity_{user_id}_{date-hour}`
- Retention: 24 hours in cache, permanent in logs

---

### 4. ✅ Automatic IP Blacklisting

**Triggers**:
- 10+ failed payment attempts within 1 hour
- Manual blacklisting via admin (if needed)
- Blacklist duration: 7 days

**Effects**:
- All checkout attempts blocked
- Clear error message to user
- Critical log entry created

  (Remove XSS code)
         ↓
   Fraud Detection
   ┌──────────────┐
   │ Velocity     │ → Too many orders? → Block
   │ IP Reputation│ → Blacklisted IP?  → Block
   │ Order Pattern│ → Suspicious amount? → Log
   └──────────────┘
         ↓
   Risk Score Calculation
         ↓
   Score >= 70? → Block & Flag for Review
   Score 40-69? → Allow & Log Suspicious
   Score < 40?  → Allow & Process
         ↓
   Payment Processing
         ↓
   Failed? → Record Failed Attempt
         ↓
   10 Failures? → Auto-Blacklist IP

## Security Testing Checklist

### XSS Prevention Tests:
```bash
# Test 1: Script injection in customer notes
POST /checkout/process
customer_notes=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
Expected: Script removed, order proceeds safely

# Test 2: Event handler in delivery address
POST /checkout/process
delivery_address=123 Main St<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
Expected: Cleaned to "123 Main St"

# Test 3: JavaScript protocol
POST /checkout/process
delivery_instructions=<a href="javascript:alert(1)">Click</a>
Expected: Link removed or href sanitized
```

### Fraud Detection Tests:
```bash
# Test 1: Velocity blocking
# Place 6 orders within 1 hour
Expected: 6th order blocked with error message

# Test 2: IP reputation
# Simulate 10 orders from same IP with different users
Expected: Flagged as suspicious, potentially blocked

# Test 3: Failed payment blocking
# Attempt 10 failed payments
Expected: IP automatically blacklisted
```

### Risk Scoring Tests:
```bash
# Test 1: High risk (Score 70+)
# New user + Large order + Rapid attempts
Expected: Order blocked, admin notified

# Test 2: Medium risk (Score 40-69)
# Established user + Slightly high order
Expected: Order allowed, logged for review
```

## Configuration

### Fraud Detection Thresholds (Configurable):
```php
// In FraudDetectionService.php

// Velocity limits
MAX_ORDERS_PER_HOUR_USER = 5;
MAX_ORDERS_PER_HOUR_IP = 10;
MAX_FAILED_PAYMENTS = 10;

// Risk score thresholds
BLOCK_THRESHOLD = 70;
LOG_THRESHOLD = 40;

// IP blacklist duration
BLACKLIST_DURATION = 7 days;
```

### HTML Purifier Config:
```php
// Allowed tags in notes
'HTML.Allowed' => 'p,br,strong,em,u'

// Address fields: NO HTML allowed
strip_tags($address)
```

## Integration with Existing Features

### Works With:
✅ Rate Limiting (from Sprint 1)
✅ CSRF Protection (from Sprint 1)
✅ Wallet Transaction Locking (from Sprint 1)
✅ Database Indexes (from Sprint 1)

### Complementary Security Layers:
```
Layer 1: Rate Limiting (30 req/min cart, 10 req/min checkout)
Layer 2: CSRF Protection (All POST requests)
Layer 3: Input Sanitization (XSS prevention)
Layer 4: Fraud Detection (Velocity & patterns)
Layer 5: Transaction Locking (Race condition prevention)
Layer 6: Wallet Validation (Balance checks)
```

---

## Admin Monitoring

### View Suspicious Activity:
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "Suspicious activity"

# View blocked orders
grep "Blocked order attempt" storage/logs/laravel.log

# Check blacklisted IPs
php artisan tinker
>>> Cache::get('ip_blacklist_192.168.1.1')
```

### Manually Blacklist IP:
```php
use App\Services\FraudDetectionService;

$fraudService = app(FraudDetectionService::class);
$fraudService->blacklistIp('192.168.1.100', 'Manual admin action');
```
