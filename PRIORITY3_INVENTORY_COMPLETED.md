# Priority 3: Inventory Management - Completion Report

**Completion Date**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

---

## Overview

Priority 3 implemented a comprehensive inventory management system to prevent overselling, track stock movements, and automate low stock alerts. The system includes reservation mechanisms, audit trails, and real-time synchronization.

---

## Completed Features

### 1. ✅ Inventory Reservation System

**Purpose**: Hold stock during checkout to prevent overselling

**Database Table**: `package_reservations`

#### Features:
- **15-Minute Hold**: Stock reserved when user enters checkout
- **Automatic Expiration**: Reservations expire if not completed
- **Session Tracking**: Tied to user session and user ID
- **Status Management**: active, completed, expired, cancelled

#### Reservation Flow:
```
User Adds to Cart
      ↓
User Proceeds to Checkout
      ↓
System Creates Reservation (15 min)
      ↓
Stock Locked for This User
      ↓
Payment Successful? → Complete Reservation → Deduct Inventory
Payment Failed? → Expire Reservation → Release Inventory
Time Expired? → Auto-Expire → Release Inventory
```

#### Model: `PackageReservation`
**Key Methods**:
- `isExpired()` - Check if reservation has expired
- `isActive()` - Check if reservation is still valid
- `complete()` - Mark as completed after payment
- `cancel()` - Cancel reservation manually
- `expire()` - Mark as expired

---

### 2. ✅ Real-Time Stock Synchronization

**Purpose**: Prevent overselling through database locking and real-time checks

#### Anti-Overselling Mechanisms:
1. **Database Row Locking**: `lockForUpdate()` on package queries
2. **Available Stock Calculation**: `Total - Active Reservations`
3. **Transaction Isolation**: All inventory changes in DB transactions
4. **Double Validation**: Check stock before reservation AND before deduction

#### Synchronized Operations:
```php
DB::transaction(function () {
    $package = Package::where('id', $id)->lockForUpdate()->first();

    // Check available stock (total - reserved)
    $availableStock = $this->getAvailableStock($package);

    if ($availableStock >= $requestedQuantity) {
        // Create reservation or complete sale
    } else {
        // Reject - insufficient stock
    }
});
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Zero overselling incidents possible
- ✅ Multiple concurrent users handled safely
- ✅ Reservations respected across all sessions
- ✅ Stock levels always accurate

---

### 3. ✅ Low Stock Alert System

**Purpose**: Notify admins when inventory runs low

**Email**: `LowStockAlert` mailable

#### Alert Triggers:
- Stock level falls below threshold (default: 10 units)
- Configurable via `SystemSetting::get('low_stock_threshold')`
- Sent to all users with 'admin' role

#### Smart Alerting:
- **24-Hour Cache**: Prevents email spam
- **One Alert Per Day** per package
- **Automatic Delivery**: Triggered after sales, adjustments, returns

#### Email Contents:
- Package name and ID
- Current stock level
- Low stock threshold
- Direct link to restock page
- Inventory history summary

---

### 4. ✅ Inventory Audit Trail

**Purpose**: Complete tracking of all inventory movements

**Database Table**: `inventory_logs`

#### Logged Actions:
1. **restock** - Adding inventory
2. **sale** - Selling products (completed orders)
3. **reservation** - Creating stock holds
4. **release** - Releasing reserved stock
5. **adjustment** - Manual corrections (damages, corrections)
6. **return** - Customer returns

#### Log Data:
- Package ID
- Action type
- Quantity before/after
- Quantity change (+/-)
- User who performed action
- Reference (order number, reservation ID)
- Notes
- Metadata (additional context)
- Timestamp

#### Use Cases:
- **Accountability**: Who changed inventory and when
- **Troubleshooting**: Track down discrepancies
- **Analytics**: Sales velocity, turnover rates
- **Compliance**: Audit trail for financial reconciliation

---

### 5. ✅ Comprehensive Inventory Service

**Service**: `App\Services\InventoryManagementService`

#### Key Methods:

##### Reservation Management:
- `reserveInventory()` - Create 15-min reservation
- `releaseReservation()` - Release expired/cancelled
- `completeReservation()` - Finalize after payment
- `getAvailableStock()` - Calculate actual available

##### Stock Operations:
- `restockInventory()` - Add stock
- `adjustInventory()` - Manual corrections
- `logInventoryChange()` - Audit trail entry

##### Monitoring:
- `checkLowStockAlert()` - Trigger email alerts
- `cleanupExpiredReservations()` - Remove expired
- `getInventoryStats()` - Analytics and reporting

---

## Database Schema

### `package_reservations` Table:
```sql
id (primary key)
package_id (foreign key)
user_id (foreign key)
quantity (int)
session_id (indexed)
expires_at (datetime, indexed)
status (enum: active, completed, expired, cancelled)
reference (order number if completed)
created_at, updated_at

Indexes:
- session_id
- expires_at
- (expires_at, status) composite
```

### `inventory_logs` Table:
```sql
id (primary key)
package_id (foreign key)
action (enum, indexed)
quantity_before (int)
quantity_after (int)
quantity_change (int, can be negative)
user_id (nullable foreign key)
reference (order #, reservation #, etc.)
notes (text)
metadata (json)
created_at, updated_at

Indexes:
- action
- (package_id, created_at) composite
- (action, created_at) composite
```

---

## Automated Cleanup

### Cron Command:
```bash
php artisan inventory:cleanup-reservations
```

**What It Does**:
- Finds all expired reservations (status=active, expires_at < now)
- Marks them as 'expired'
- Logs the release in inventory_logs
- Makes stock available again

**Recommended Schedule**:
```php
// In app/Console/Kernel.php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule): void
{
    $schedule->command('inventory:cleanup-reservations')
             ->everyFiveMinutes();
}
```

---

## Inventory Statistics

The service provides comprehensive analytics:

```php
$stats = $inventoryService->getInventoryStats($package, $days = 30);
```

**Returns**:
```php
[
    'package_id' => 1,
    'current_stock' => 50,
    'available_stock' => 45,  // After reservations
    'reserved_stock' => 5,
    'period_days' => 30,
    'sales_quantity' => 120,  // Sold in period
    'restock_quantity' => 100,
    'adjustment_quantity' => -5,
    'turnover_rate' => 240,   // Percentage
    'avg_daily_sales' => 4.0,
    'days_until_stockout' => 11,  // Estimated
]
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Reservation System
```bash
# User 1 adds item to cart, goes to checkout
# Reservation created for 15 minutes
# User 2 tries to buy same item (only 1 left)
Expected: User 2 sees "Out of Stock" (reserved for User 1)

# Wait 15 minutes without completing checkout
# Run: php artisan inventory:cleanup-reservations
Expected: Reservation expired, stock available again
```

### Test 2: Overselling Prevention
```bash
# Stock: 5 units
# User A and User B simultaneously add 5 units each to cart
# Both proceed to checkout at exact same time
Expected: First to pay gets 5 units
          Second sees "Insufficient stock" error
```

### Test 3: Low Stock Alert
```bash
# Set threshold: 10 units
# Package has 12 units
# Complete 2 orders (2 units total)
# Stock now: 10 units
Expected: Low stock email sent to all admins
```

### Test 4: Audit Trail
```bash
# Admin restocks 50 units
# Customer buys 10 units
# Admin adjusts down by 5 (damaged goods)
# Check inventory_logs table
Expected: 3 entries with correct before/after quantities
```

---

## Configuration

### System Settings:
```php
// Set low stock threshold
SystemSetting::set('low_stock_threshold', 10, 'integer');

// Get current threshold
$threshold = SystemSetting::get('low_stock_threshold', 10);
```

### Reservation Duration:
Currently hardcoded to 15 minutes. To change:
```php
// In InventoryManagementService::reserveInventory()
'expires_at' => now()->addMinutes(15),  // Change this
```

### Cleanup Frequency:
```php
// In app/Console/Kernel.php
$schedule->command('inventory:cleanup-reservations')
         ->everyFiveMinutes();  // Adjust as needed
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Load:
- **Indexes**: All critical queries indexed
- **Locking**: Only holds locks for milliseconds
- **Cleanup**: Runs in background, non-blocking

### Scalability:
- **Concurrent Users**: Handled via row locking
- **High Volume**: Transaction-safe at any scale
- **Large Inventory**: Indexed queries remain fast

### Caching:
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Cached for 24 hours
- **Available Stock**: Calculated on-the-fly (always accurate)
- **Reservations**: Real-time, no caching

---

## Security Features

### Built-In Protection:
✅ Database transaction isolation
✅ Row-level locking prevents race conditions
✅ User/session binding prevents hijacking
✅ Automatic expiration prevents indefinite holds
✅ Audit trail for accountability
✅ Admin-only restock/adjustment access
