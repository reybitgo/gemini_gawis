## Testing After Reset

### Quick Verification Steps

1. **Login Test**
   ```
   Navigate to /login
   Use admin credentials
   Should redirect to /dashboard
   ```

2. **Package Performance Test**
   ```
   Navigate to /packages
   Page should load in <2 seconds
   Click on a package
   Second visit should be cached (faster)
   ```

3. **Cart Operations Test**
   ```
   Add package to cart
   Update quantity
   Remove from cart
   All operations should be smooth with rate limiting
   ```

4. **Checkout Test**
   ```
   Add package to cart
   Navigate to /checkout
   Complete order with wallet payment
   Verify wallet balance deduction
   Check order history
   ```

5. **Order Fulfillment & Return Test**
   ```
   As Admin:
   - Navigate to /admin/orders
   - Mark order as delivered (set delivery timestamp)

   As Customer:
   - Navigate to /orders/{order}
   - Verify "Return Request" section appears
   - Submit return request with reason and description

   As Admin:
   - Navigate to /admin/returns
   - Verify pending return request appears with badge
   - Approve or reject the return request
   ```

6. **Security Test**
   ```
   Try rapid checkout submissions (should be rate-limited)
   Check order numbers (should be non-sequential)
   Verify CSRF tokens in network tab
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Reset doesn't show Sprint 1 features
**Solution**: Run migrations manually first:
```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed --class=DatabaseResetSeeder
```

### Issue: Package pages still slow
**Solution**: Clear cache and reload:
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
```

### Issue: Indexes not created
**Solution**: Run the indexes migration directly:
```bash
php artisan migrate --path=database/migrations/2025_09_30_102311_add_performance_indexes_to_tables.php
```

### Issue: Cache not working
**Check**:
```bash
# Check .env file
CACHE_STORE=database  # or redis

# Test cache
php artisan tinker
>>> Cache::put('test', 'value', 60);
>>> Cache::get('test');
```

---

## Production Recommendations

Before deploying to production:

1. **Verify Timezone Configuration**
   ```env
   APP_TIMEZONE=Asia/Manila
   ```
   The system is configured to use **Asia/Manila** timezone for all timestamps.

2. **Switch to Redis Cache**
   ```env
   CACHE_STORE=redis
   REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   ```

3. **Enable Query Logging (Temporarily)**
   ```bash
   php artisan tinker
   >>> DB::enableQueryLog();
   # Navigate around the app
   >>> count(DB::getQueryLog());
   ```
   Should be <20 queries per page

4. **Monitor Performance**
   - Page load times should be <2s
   - Cart operations should be <500ms
   - Checkout should complete in <1s

5. **Security Audit**
   - Verify rate limiting works: `ab -n 35 -c 5 http://your-site.com/cart/add/1`
   - Check order numbers are random
   - Verify CSRF tokens on all POST requests

---

## Maintenance Schedule

### Weekly
- Review order patterns
- Check for slow queries in logs
- Verify cache hit rates

### Monthly
- Review rate limiting logs
- Analyze order number patterns (should be random)
- Check wallet transaction logs for anomalies

### After Major Updates
- Run `/reset` to ensure latest optimizations
- Test all critical paths
- Verify performance metrics

## Important Notes

### User ID Sequencing
After reset, users are recreated with proper sequential IDs:
- Admin user: **ID = 1**
- Member user: **ID = 2**

This ensures clean database state and prevents ID gaps that can occur from repeated testing.

### Return Process Tables
The following tables are now included in the reset:
- `return_requests` - Customer return submissions
- `order_status_histories` - Complete order lifecycle tracking

### Auto-Increment Reset
All cleared tables have their auto-increment counters reset to 1:
- ✅ `users` (after recreation)
- ✅ `orders`
- ✅ `order_items`
- ✅ `order_status_histories`
- ✅ `return_requests`
- ✅ `transactions`

This provides a clean slate for testing and ensures consistent data patterns.
