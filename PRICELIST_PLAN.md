### Phase 1: Data Retrieval and Backend Logic

This phase focuses on creating the necessary backend components to fetch package data from the database.

1.  **Investigate the `Package` Model:** I will start by examining `app/Models/Package.php` to understand its attributes and relationships. This will confirm the fields available for each package (name, price, points, quantity, features, etc.).
2.  **Analyze Database Structure:** I will look into the database migrations to understand how the `packages` table and any related tables (like for features) are structured.
3.  **Create a Controller Method:** I will modify the controller that renders the frontend's main page. A new method will be added to fetch all packages from the database.
4.  **Pass Data to the View:** The controller method will pass the retrieved package data to the `resources/views/frontend/index.blade.php` view.
5.  **Testing:** I will add a temporary `dd($packages)` to the view to confirm that the correct data is being fetched and passed to the view before moving to the next phase.

### Phase 2: Frontend Structure and Integration

This phase will create the basic HTML structure for the price list within the main frontend view.

1.  **Analyze `index.blade.php`:** I will read `resources/views/frontend/index.blade.php` to identify the best section to add the price list.
2.  **Analyze `gawis_pricelist.html`:** I will examine `public/gawis_pricelist.html` to understand the HTML structure of the price list design.
3.  **Create the Blade View:** I will create a new Blade component or a section within `index.blade.php` for the price list.
4.  **Loop Through Packages:** I will use a `@foreach` loop in the Blade view to iterate over the packages passed from the controller and display the package information (name, price, etc.) in a basic, unstyled format. The structure will be designed to accommodate up to three packages, as requested.
5.  **Testing:** I will load the frontend page in a browser to ensure the package information is displayed correctly, without any styling.

### Phase 3: Styling with Tailwind CSS

This phase will apply the styling to the price list to match the design of `gawis_pricelist.html`, using the project's existing Tailwind CSS framework.

1.  **Extract Styles:** I will analyze the CSS from `public/gawis_pricelist.html` to identify the key styling rules (colors, fonts, spacing, etc.).
2.  **Convert to Tailwind CSS:** I will translate the extracted CSS rules into Tailwind CSS utility classes.
3.  **Apply Styles to the Blade View:** I will add the Tailwind CSS classes to the HTML elements in the price list Blade view created in Phase 2.
4.  **Ensure Responsiveness:** I will use Tailwind's responsive design features to ensure the price list looks good on various screen sizes.
5.  **Testing:** I will visually inspect the price list in a browser on different devices (or by resizing the browser window) to confirm that it matches the desired design and is responsive.
