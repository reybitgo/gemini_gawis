# Conditional Email Implementation

## Overview
This implementation ensures that email notifications are only sent to users with verified email addresses. If a user hasn't verified their email, the system will:
1. Skip sending the email to the user
2. Log the event with proper warnings
3. Notify administrators about the unverified user activity

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files

1. **`app/Services/EmailService.php`**
   - Helper service for conditional email sending
   - Methods:
     - `sendToUserIfVerified()` - Send email only if user email is verified
     - `sendToUsersIfVerified()` - Bulk send to multiple users
     - `notifyAdminsAboutUnverifiedUser()` - Notify admins when user email not verified

2. **`app/Mail/UnverifiedUserOrderNotification.php`**
   - Mailable class for notifying admins about unverified user activity
   - Sent when order status changes for users without verified emails

3. **`resources/views/emails/admin/unverified-user-order.blade.php`**
   - Email template for admin notifications
   - Shows user info, order details, and action required message

### Modified Files

1. **`app/Services/OrderStatusService.php`**
   - Updated `sendStatusChangeNotification()` method
   - Now checks if user email is verified before sending
   - Logs warnings and notifies admins when email skipped
   - Added `notifyAdminsAboutUnverifiedUser()` method

## How It Works

### Order Status Change Flow

1. When an order status changes, the system calls `sendStatusChangeNotification()`
2. The method checks: `$user->hasVerifiedEmail()`
3. If **verified**:
   - Email sent to user
   - Success logged
4. If **not verified**:
   - Email skipped for user
   - Warning logged with user details
   - Admin notification sent to all admins with verified emails

### Admin Notification

Admins receive an email with:
- User information (name, ID, email status)
- Order details (order number, status, total, date)
- Link to view order in admin panel
- Recommendation to contact user through alternative means

### Logging

All email activities are logged:
- **INFO**: Successful email sends
- **WARNING**: Skipped emails due to unverified status
- **ERROR**: Failed email sending attempts

Log entries include:
- User ID and details
- Order information
- Notification type
- Context/reason

## Usage Examples

### Using EmailService Helper

```php
use App\Services\EmailService;

// Send to single user
EmailService::sendToUserIfVerified(
    $user,
    new OrderStatusChanged($order, $oldStatus, $newStatus),
    'Order status change'
);

// Send to multiple users
$results = EmailService::sendToUsersIfVerified(
    $users,
    new SomeNotification(),
    'Bulk notification'
);

// Results: ['sent' => 5, 'skipped' => 2, 'skipped_users' => [...]]
```

### Manual Implementation

```php
if ($user->hasVerifiedEmail()) {
    // Send email
    Mail::to($user->email)->send($mailable);
    Log::info('Email sent', ['user_id' => $user->id]);
} else {
    // Log and notify admins
    Log::warning('Email skipped - unverified', [
        'user_id' => $user->id,
        'context' => 'Description of what email was skipped'
    ]);
    // Optionally notify admins
}
```

## Future Email Implementations

When adding new email notifications in the system, always use this pattern:

1. Check `$user->hasVerifiedEmail()` before sending
2. Log appropriately (INFO for sent, WARNING for skipped)
3. Consider notifying admins for important activities
4. Use the `EmailService` helper for consistency

## Areas Already Implemented

✅ **Order Status Changes** - `OrderStatusService.php`
- Order status notifications to customers
- Admin notifications for unverified users

✅ **Wallet Payment Confirmations** - `WalletPaymentService.php`
- Payment confirmation emails to customers
- Admin notifications for unverified user payments

✅ **Inventory Management** - `InventoryManagementService.php`
- Low stock alerts to admins
- Only sends to admins with verified emails

✅ **Wallet Deposits** - `WalletController.php` (processDeposit)
- Admin notifications for new deposit requests
- Only sends to admins with verified emails

✅ **Wallet Withdrawals** - `WalletController.php` (processWithdraw)
- Admin notifications for new withdrawal requests
- Only sends to admins with verified emails

✅ **Order Cancellations** - `OrderHistoryController.php`
- Cancellation confirmation emails to customers
- Skipped for unverified users with proper logging

✅ **Transaction Approvals** - `AdminController.php` (approveTransaction)
- Approval notifications to users for deposits and withdrawals
- Only sends to users with verified emails

✅ **Transaction Rejections** - `AdminController.php` (rejectTransaction)
- Rejection notifications to users for deposits and withdrawals
- Only sends to users with verified emails

## Areas to Implement (If Needed)

The following areas may send emails in the future and should use this pattern:

- **Wallet Transfers** - Transfer confirmation emails (if added in future)
- **Account Security** - Password changes, 2FA changes
- **System Announcements** - Important system updates
- **Order Delivery Updates** - Tracking and delivery notifications (when delivery system is implemented)

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Create a user without verified email
2. Place an order and change its status
3. Check logs for warning messages
4. Verify admin receives notification
5. Confirm user does NOT receive email

## Configuration

No additional configuration needed. The system uses:
- Laravel's built-in `hasVerifiedEmail()` method
- Existing mail configuration
- Spatie's role system for admin detection

## Benefits

1. **No Interruptions** - Users without email can use the system fully
2. **Admin Awareness** - Admins are notified of unverified user activities
3. **Proper Logging** - All email activities tracked
4. **Graceful Degradation** - System continues working even if emails can't be sent
5. **User Choice** - Users not forced to provide/verify email
6. **Audit Trail** - Complete record of who received/didn't receive emails
