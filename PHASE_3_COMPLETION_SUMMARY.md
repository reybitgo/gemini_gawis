## 📁 Files Created (5)

### 1. Database Migration
**File**: `database/migrations/2025_10_07_105237_add_mlm_fields_to_transactions_table.php`

**Purpose**: Adds MLM tracking fields to transactions table

**Schema Changes**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE transactions
  ADD COLUMN level TINYINT UNSIGNED NULL,
  ADD COLUMN source_order_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
  ADD COLUMN source_type ENUM('mlm', 'deposit', 'transfer', 'purchase', 'withdrawal', 'refund'),
  ADD INDEX idx_source_order (source_order_id),
  ADD INDEX idx_source_type (source_type),
  ADD INDEX idx_type_source_type (type, source_type),
  ADD FOREIGN KEY (source_order_id) REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

---

### 2. MLM Commission Service
**File**: `app/Services/MLMCommissionService.php`

**Purpose**: Complete commission processing service with upline traversal

**Key Methods**:
- `processCommissions(Order $order): bool` - Main commission distribution logic
- `getUplineTree(User $user, int $maxLevels): array` - Retrieves upline chain
- `calculateTotalCommission(int $packageId): float` - Calculates total possible commissions
- `getCommissionBreakdown(Order $order): array` - Shows commission distribution preview

**Features**:
- Transaction-safe processing with rollback on failure
- Comprehensive logging for audit trail and debugging
- Handles missing wallets and incomplete upline gracefully
- Prevents duplicate commission distribution

---

### 3. Multi-Channel Notification
**File**: `app/Notifications/MLMCommissionEarned.php`

**Purpose**: Notify upline members of commission earnings

**Channels**:
1. **Database** - Always sent, stored in `notifications` table
2. **Broadcast** - Real-time via Laravel Echo (if configured)
3. **Email** - Conditional (ONLY if `email_verified_at` IS NOT NULL)

**Email Features**:
- Professional HTML template
- Commission amount and level details
- Buyer information
- Order number and package name
- "View Dashboard" call-to-action button
- Sent during commission processing (may be queued by Laravel notification system)

---

### 4. Commission Processing Job
**File**: `app/Jobs/ProcessMLMCommissions.php`
**Note**: Executed synchronously via `dispatchSync()`, not queued.

**Purpose**: Async processing of commission distribution

**Configuration**:
- **Tries**: 3 attempts
- **Timeout**: 120 seconds
- **Backoff**: Exponential (10s, 30s, 60s)

**Error Handling**:
- Comprehensive logging on failure
- Failed job tracking in `failed_jobs` table
- Graceful degradation (continues even if some upline members fail)

---

### 5. MLM Balance Widget
**File**: `resources/views/components/mlm-balance-widget.blade.php`

**Purpose**: Real-time MLM balance display

**Features**:
- MLM Balance (withdrawable)
- Purchase Balance (non-withdrawable)
- Total Balance calculation
- Live update animation (pulse effect)
- Toast notifications for new commissions
- Laravel Echo integration for real-time broadcasts
- Quick links to withdrawal and referral pages

---

## 🔧 Files Modified (4)

### 1. Transaction Model
**File**: `app/Models/Transaction.php`

**Changes**:
- Added `level`, `source_order_id`, `source_type` to fillable
- Added `sourceOrder()` relationship
- Added `isMLMCommission()` helper method
- Added `mlm_level` attribute accessor

---

### 2. Wallet Model
**File**: `app/Models/Wallet.php`

**New Methods**:
- `deductCombinedBalance(float $amount): bool` - Deduct from purchase first, then MLM
- `getMLMBalanceSummary(): array` - Complete balance breakdown
- `canWithdraw(float $amount): bool` - Check withdrawal eligibility

**Existing Methods Enhanced**:
- `getTotalBalanceAttribute()` - MLM + Purchase balance
- `getWithdrawableBalanceAttribute()` - MLM balance only

---

### 3. Checkout Controller
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/CheckoutController.php`

**Integration Point**:
```php
// After successful payment
if ($order->package && $order->package->is_mlm_package) {
    ProcessMLMCommissions::dispatchSync($order);

    Log::info('MLM Commission Job Dispatched', [
        'order_id' => $order->id,
        'order_number' => $order->order_number,
        'package_id' => $order->package_id,
        'package_name' => $order->package->name
    ]);
}
```

---

### 4. Dashboard View
**File**: `resources/views/dashboard.blade.php`

**Additions**:
1. **MLM Balance Widget** - Shows MLM earnings and balances
2. **MLM Network Stats Panel** - Direct referrals and total earnings
3. **Quick Action Buttons** - Links to referral page and member registration

---

## 📊 Database Schema

### Transactions Table (Enhanced)

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  type ENUM('deposit', 'withdrawal', 'payment', 'refund', 'mlm_commission', 'transfer'),
  level TINYINT UNSIGNED NULL,              -- NEW: MLM level (1-5)
  source_order_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,     -- NEW: Links to orders.id
  source_type ENUM(...),                    -- NEW: Transaction category
  amount DECIMAL(15,2),
  status ENUM('pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'blocked', 'completed'),
  description TEXT NULL,
  metadata JSON NULL,
  reference_number VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP,

  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (source_order_id) REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  INDEX idx_source_order (source_order_id),
  INDEX idx_source_type (source_type),
  INDEX idx_type_source_type (type, source_type)
);
```

## 🔔 Notification System

### Channel Selection Logic

```php
public function via($notifiable): array
{
    $channels = ['database', 'broadcast'];

    // Only send email if user has verified email
    if ($notifiable->hasVerifiedEmail()) {
        $channels[] = 'mail';
    }

    return $channels;
}
```

### Email Notification Example

## 🛡️ Error Handling

### Edge Cases Handled

1. **Incomplete Upline Chain** - Distributes to available levels only
2. **Missing Wallet** - Logs warning, continues with other upline members
3. **Orphaned User (No Sponsor)** - No commissions distributed, job completes successfully
4. **Non-MLM Package** - Job not dispatched
5. **Duplicate Prevention** - Transaction checks prevent double distribution
6. **Circular Sponsorship** - Prevented at model and database level
7. **Commission Error** - Transaction rollback prevents partial distribution
8. **Database Connection Lost** - Retry with exponential backoff
