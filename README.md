## üèÅ Getting Started

### 1. Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url> laravel-ecommerce
cd laravel-ecommerce

# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Generate application key
php artisan key:generate
```

### 3. Database Setup
- Edit the `.env` file with your database credentials.
- Run the migrations to create the database schema:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 4. Database Reset (Recommended for Initial Setup)
For a clean start with all the necessary seed data, use the built-in database reset command. This will set up the database schema, default users, roles, permissions, and sample products/packages.

**To reset the database, navigate to `/reset` in your browser.**

You will be asked for confirmation. After confirming, the system will:
- Run all database migrations.
- Seed the database with default data.
- Clear all caches.

### 5. Running the Application
```bash
# Start the development server, queue worker, log viewer, and Vite dev server
composer dev

# Or run them individually:
php artisan serve
php artisan queue:listen --tries=1
php artisan pail --timeout=0
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000` (or as configured).

### 6. Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
