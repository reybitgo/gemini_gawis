# Frontend Development Blueprint: Gawis iHerbal

## 1. Project Vision & Goals

The primary goal is to evolve the platform from a backend-focused application to a complete online presence with a public-facing website. This website will serve as the digital storefront and recruitment hub for Gawis iHerbal.

**Core Objectives:**
